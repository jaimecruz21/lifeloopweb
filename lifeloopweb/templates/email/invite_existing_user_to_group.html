    <p>
        You're getting this email because a manager of 
        <strong>{{ group.name }}</strong>
        wants to invite you to be a member! <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(This group was created by 
        <strong>{{ group.parent_org.name }}</strong>, 
        but this invite will not automatically register you as a member of that organization)</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        As an existing <a href="{{ index_url }}">LifeLoop.Live</a> member, you simply need to click the link below to login and accept the group invitation.
